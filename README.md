This Github project is the *Xinu Operating System* running on several platforms,
including the venerable Sun3/50.   It encompasses work I did at
Pacific Data Products (long since defunct) 30 years ago

There is also code that runs on the *MIO Board* from Pacific Data Products.
It was a 68000-based board that plugged into LaserJets and gave them
networking connectivity.

The Project also contains a small amount of code for boards based on the
80960 micro-controller that Intel used to make.

I was the "Xinu Guy" for a few years back in the early 90's, and it all
started with work I did at Systech Corp.   While at Systech, and mostly
as proof-of-concept, I ported Xinu to one of Systech's 68000-based boards.

But the real *Trophy* was a port of Xinu to a Systech board designed
around the Intel 80960-CA.    Running at a whopping 66Mhz.

Xinu made for a wonderful development platform, ideal for the embedded
environment.

Ahhhhh..... Those were the days!!

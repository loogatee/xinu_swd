The executable target name is indeed config.o.  It has the .o extension
purely to help co-exist more peacefully with CVS.  If the executable's
name is just config (the logical choice), then a "cvs update"  shows
this file prefaced by ?.  With the .o, "cvs update" just ignores it
and does not list it in the update.

/*
 * $Log: despool.c,v $
 * Revision 1.3  1993/01/30  02:55:41  johnr
 * JR:  Added eof_flag as a parameter to backend_write.  This meant that the
 *      code which determined the state of eof_flag needed to be moved before
 *      the backend_write statement.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1992/12/22  18:56:44  johnr
 * JR:  Took out both network.h and tty.h from the includes.  Renamed
 *      backend_d to despool_d.  Took out the tty specific stuff and made
 *      a generic interface to the backend-driver code by calling function
 *      backend_write.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1992/11/25  22:54:28  johnr
 * JR:  1st entry for these files, in the new directory layout.
